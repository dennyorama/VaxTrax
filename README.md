This was a school project I worked on with a team of three people. 

The project was to build an application that could be used by vaccination sites to record vaccination information from patients.
The application required a user interface and database. This was built in Microsoft Visual Studio using C#/.NET and the database was built using 
Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio and hosted by the school web server.

The application allows a user to create, read, and update patient information and vaccination information to/from the database.
